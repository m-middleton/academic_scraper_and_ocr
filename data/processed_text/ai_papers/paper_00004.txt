}

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for lowdimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global structure and local detail in generated samples. While diffusion models have shown remarkable success in high-dimensional spaces, their application to low-dimensional data remains crucial for understanding fundamental model behaviors and addressing real-world applications with inherently low-dimensional data. However, in these spaces, traditional models often struggle to simultaneously capture both macro-level patterns and fine-grained features, leading to suboptimal sample quality. We propose a novel architecture incorporating two parallel branches: a global branch processing the original input and a local branch handling an upscaled veriÔ¨Åcation. We propose a novel architecture for the model-based models to be balanced balancing their contributions. We evaluate our method on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality, with KL divergence reductions of up to 12.8 % compared to the baseline model. The adaptive weighting successfully adjusts the focus between global and local features across different datasets and denoising stages, as evidenced by our weight evolution analysis.. This work not only enhances low-dimensional diffusion models but also provides insights that could inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains, opening new avenues for advancing generative modeling across various applications.

\section*{1 INTRODUCTION}
Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in various domains such as image synthesis, audio generation, and molecular design [Yang et al. (2023). While these models have shown remarkable capabilities in capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality samples in high-dimensional spaces [Ho et al. (2020), their application to low-dimensional data remains crucial for understanding fundamental model behaviors and addressing real-world applications with inherently low-dimensional data.
The challenge in applying diffusion models to low-dimensional spaces lies in simultaneously capturing both the global structure and local details of the data distribution. In these spaces, each dimension carries significant information about the overall structure, making the balance between global coherence and local nuance particularly crucial. Traditional diffusion models often struggle to achieve this balance, resulting in generated samples that either lack coherent global structure or miss out the data.
To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models. Our method introduces a novel architecture that processes the input at two scales: a global scale capturing overall structure, and a local scale focusing on fine-grained details. The key innovation lies in our learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically balances the contributions of these two scales throughout the denoising process.
We evaluate our approach on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality, with reductions in KL divergence of up to 12.8
Our main contributions are:
- A novel adaptive dual-scale denoising architecture for low-dimensional diffusion models that dynamically balances global structure and local details.
- A learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that allows the model to adjust its focus throughout the denoising process.
- Comprehensive empirical evaluations on various 2D datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and generation fidelity.
- Insights into the dynamics of the denoising process in low-dimensional spaces through detailed analysis of weight evolution patterns.
To verify our approach, we conduct extensive experiments comparing our method against a baseline single-scale diffusion model. We evaluate performance using KL divergence, visual inspection of generated samples, and analysis of computational efficiency. Our results show consistent improvements in sample quality across all datasets, with the most substantial improvement observed in the complex dino dataset.
This work not only advances the understanding and performance of diffusion models in lowdimensional spaces but also opens up new avenues for improving these models in higher-dimensional domains. Future work could explore extending our adaptive dual-scale approach to more complex, higher-dimensional data, potentially leading to improvements in areas such as image synthesis, 3D shape generation, or modeling molecular structures for drug discovery.

\section*{2 RELATED WORK}
Our work on adaptive dual-scale denoising for low-dimensional diffusion models builds upon and extends several key areas of research in generative modeling and multi-scale approaches. This section compares and contrasts our approach with relevant academic siblings, highlighting the unique aspects of our method.
\subsection*{2.1 Multi-SCALE APPROACHES IN DIFFUSION MODELS}
Multi-scale approaches have been explored in diffusion models to improve sample quality and generation efficiency. Karras et al. (2022a) proposed a multi-scale architecture for diffusion models, demonstrating improvements in both sample quality and inference speed. Their Elucidating Diffusion Models (EDM) use a fixed hierarchy of scales, in contrast to our adaptive approach. While EDM focuses on high-dimensional image generation, our method is specifically tailored for low-dimensional spaces, where the balance between global and local features is particularly crucial.
Similarly, Ho et al. (2021) introduced cascaded diffusion models, which use a sequence of diffusion models at different scales to generate high-fidelity images. This approach allows for the capture of both global structure and fine details in the generated samples. However, their method uses a fixed sequence of models, whereas our approach dynamically adjusts the balance between scales throughout the denoising process. Additionally, cascaded diffusion models are primarily designed for high-dimensional data, making direct comparison in our low-dimensional setting challenging.
Our work differs from these approaches by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically balances the contributions of different scales throughout the denoising process. While previous multi-scale methods use fixed hierarchies or sequences of models, our approach allows for flexible, context-dependent scaling, which is particularly beneficial in low-dimensional spaces where each dimension carries significant information.

\subsection*{2.2 Adaptive Mechanisms in Generative Models}
Adaptive mechanisms have been explored in various contexts within generative modeling. The Time-dependent Multihead Self Attention (TMSA) mechanism introduced in DiffiT Hatamizadeh et al. (2023) demonstrates the potential of adaptive, time-dependent processing in diffusion models. While conceptually similar in its time-dependent nature, our approach differs in its specific focus on balancing multi-scale features in low-dimensional spaces, rather than attention mechanisms in
high-dimensional data. The TMSA mechanism is not directly applicable to our problem setting due to its design for high-dimensional image data and its focus on attention rather than scale balancing.
Bai et al. proposed Multiscale Deep Equilibrium Models, which adapt the model's effective depth based on the input. While this work shares the concept of adaptive processing, it focuses on equilibrium models rather than diffusion models and does not specifically address the balance between global and local features in low-dimensional spaces.
Our method's learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism allows the model to adjust its focus dynamically, potentially capturing the nuances of the denoising process more effectively in low-dimensional settings. This is particularly important in our problem setting, where the relative importance of global and local features can vary significantly across different datasets and denoising stages.
\subsection*{2.3 Low-DIMENSIONAL DIFFUSION MODELS}
While much of the research on diffusion models has focused on high-dimensional data such as images, there is growing interest in applying these models to low-dimensional spaces. TabDDPM Kotelnikov et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of diffusion models in capturing complex dependencies in structured, low-dimensional spaces by applying them to tabular data generation. However, TabDDPM does not specifically address the challenge of balancing global structure and local details, which is the primary focus of our work.
Our approach extends this line of research by introducing an adaptive dual-scale method specifically designed to improve the fidelity and quality of generated samples in low-dimensional spaces. Unlike TabDDPM, which uses a standard diffusion model architecture, our method explicitly models the interplay between global and local features through its dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism.
In summary, our adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models addresses a unique niche in the literature. While it builds upon foundations laid by previous work in multi-scale and adaptive processing, it is specifically tailored to the challenges of low-dimensional spaces. Our method's dynamic balancing of global and local features sets it apart from fixed multiscale approaches and makes it particularly suited for capturing complex low-dimensional distributions. The experimental results in Section provide a quantitative comparison with a baseline diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in this specific problem setting.
\section*{3 BACKGROUND}
Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving remarkable success in various domains of machine learning [Yang et al. , These models, based on the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics (Sohl-Dickstein et al. , operate by learning to reverse a gradual noising process, allowing them to generate high-quality samples while offering stable training dynamics [Ho et al. (2020).
The diffusion process consists of two main phases:
1. Forward process: Gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data over a series of timesteps.
2. Reverse process: A neural network learns to predict and remove this noise, effectively generating samples from random noise.
Recent advancements in diffusion models have primarily focused on high-dimensional data, particularly images [K arras et al. (2022b). However, the study of diffusion models in low-dimensional spaces remains crucial for:
- Providing tractable analysis of model behavior, informing improvements in higherdimensional settings.
- Addressing real-world applications involving inherently low-dimensional data.
- Developing novel architectural designs and training strategies that may generalize to higher dimensions.
\subsection*{3.1 PROBLEM SETTING}
We focus on applying diffusion models to 2 D datasets. Let \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 be our data space, and p_{\text {data }}(\mathbf{x}) be the true data distribution over \mathcal{X}. Our goal is to learn a generative model that samples from a distribution p_{\text {model }}(\mathbf{x}) closely approximating p_{\text {data }}(\mathbf{x}).
The diffusion process is defined over T timesteps. Let \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text {data }}(\mathbf{x}) be a sample from the data distribution, and \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_T be the sequence of increasingly noisy versions of \mathbf{x}_0. The forward process is defined as:
\[
q(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_t-1)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t ; \sqrt{1-\beta_t \mathbf{x}_t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})
\]
where \beta_t is the noise schedule.
The reverse process, parameterized by a neural network \epsilon_\theta, is defined as:
\[
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t-1 \mid \mathbf{x}_t)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t-1 ; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
\]
In low-dimensional spaces, each dimension carries significant information about the overall structure of the data. This presents a unique challenge: the model must simultaneously capture both the global structure and local details of the data distribution. Traditional diffusion models often struggle to achieve this balance in low dimensions, motivating our proposed adaptive dual-scale approach.
Our approach is based on two key assumptions:
1. The importance of global and local features varies across different datasets and at different stages of the denoising process.
2. A learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism can effectively balance the contributions of global and local features during denoising.
These assumptions form the basis of our adaptive dual-scale denoising architecture, which we will describe in detail in the following section.
\section*{4 METHOD}
Our adaptive dual-scale denoising approach addresses the challenge of balancing global structure and local details in low-dimensional diffusion models. Building upon the formalism introduced in Section \underline{\mathbb{R}} we present a novel architecture that dynamically adjusts its focus between global and local features throughout the denoising process.
\subsection*{4.1 DUAL-SCALE ARCHITECTURE}
The core of our method is a dual-scale architecture that processes the input at two different scales simultaneously:
1. Global Scale: This branch processes the original input \mathbf{x}_t \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^2, capturing the overall structure of the data.
2. Local Scale: This branch processes an upscaled version of the input \mathbf{x}_t^u p \in \mathbb{R}^4, focusing on fine-grained details.
Both branches use similar network architectures, but with different input dimensions:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\epsilon_\theta^{\text {global }}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)=\operatorname{MLP}_{\text {global }}(\mathbf{x}_t, t) 

\epsilon_\theta^{\text {local }}(\mathbf{x}_t^u p, t)=\operatorname{MLP}_{\text {local }}(\mathbf{x}_t^u p, t})
\end{array}
\]
where MLP denotes a multi-layer perceptron with sinusoidal embeddings for both input and time, similar to the architecture used in the original DDPM [Ho et al. (2020). The upscaling operation \mathbf{x}_t^u p= Upscale (\mathbf{x}_t) is implemented as a learnable linear transformation:
\mathbf{x}_t^u p=W \mathbf{x}_t+\mathbf{b}
where W \in \mathbb{R}^4 \times 2 and \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^4 are learnable parameters.
\subsection*{4.2 Adaptive Weighting Mechanism}
To dynamically balance the contributions of the global and local branches, we introduce a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism:
\[
\mathbf{w}(t)=\operatorname{Softmax}(\operatorname{MLP}_w(t))
\]
where \mathbf{w}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 represents the weights for the global and local branches at timestep t. The weight network MLP_w is implemented as:
\[
\operatorname{MLP}_w(t)=\text { Linear }_2(\text { LeakyReLU }(\text { Linear }_1(\text { SinusoidalEmbedding }(t))) )
\]
This design allows for complex weight computations, enabling nuanced adaptations of the globallocal feature balance across different timesteps. The use of LeakyReLU activation and multiple linear layers provides the network with the capacity to learn non-linear relationships between the timestep and the optimal feature balance.
\subsection*{4.3 COMBINED DENOISING PROCESS}
The final denoising prediction is a weighted combination of the global and local branch outputs:
\[
\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) \equiv w_1(t) \cdot \epsilon_\theta^{\text {global }}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)+\bar{w}_2(t) \cdot \epsilon_\theta^{\text {local }}(\mathbf{x}_t^{\text {up }}, t)
\]
where w_1(t) and w_2(t) are the components of \mathbf{w}(t). This combination allows the model to leverage both global structure and local details in its predictions, with the balance dynamically adjusted based on the current timestep.
\subsection*{4.4 Training Process}
We train our model using the same objective as in the original DDPM [Ho et al. (2020):
\[
\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \epsilon}\left[\left\|\epsilon-\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)\right\|^2\right]
\]
where \epsilon is the noise added during the forward process, and the expectation is taken over timesteps t, initial samples \mathbf{x}_0, and noise \epsilon. This objective encourages the model to accurately predict and remove the noise at each timestep, while the adaptive weighting mechanism learns to balance global and local features for optimal denoising.
The training process follows the standard approach for diffusion models, with the following steps:
1. Sample a batch of data points \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text {data }}(\mathbf{x}).
2. Sample timesteps t \sim \operatorname{Uniform}({1, \ldots, T}).
3. Sample noise \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}).
4. Compute noisy samples \mathbf{x}_t using the forward process defined in Section 3
5. Compute the loss \mathcal{L} and update the model parameters using gradient descent.
Our adaptive dual-scale approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its focus between global structure and local details throughout the denoising process. This is particularly beneficial in low-dimensional spaces where each dimension carries significant information about the overall structure of the data. By dynamically balancing these two scales, our method can better capture complex data distributions and generate higher-quality samples compared to traditional single-scale approaches.

Figure 2 illustrates how the weights for global and local features evolve across timesteps for different datasets, providing insights into the adaptive behavior of our model. This visualization helps us understand how the model balances global structure and local details at various stages of the denoising process for each dataset.

\section*{6 RESULTS}
We present the results of our adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models, comparing it against a baseline single-scale model across four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our experiments consist of five main runs: Baseline (Run 0), Dual-Scale Processing with Fixed Weighting (Run 1), Adaptive Dual-Scale Processing (Run 2), Weight Evolution Analysis (Run 3), and Improved Weight Network (Run 5).
\subsection*{6.1 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS}
Table 1 summarizes the key performance metrics for each run across the datasets.
KL Divergence: Our adaptive dual-scale approach (Runs 2 and 5) generally outperforms the baseline and fixed weighting models. The final model with the improved weight network (Run 5) achieves the following improvements over the baseline:
- Circle: 2.5 % reduction (from 0.354 to 0.345 )
- Dino: 12.8 % reduction (from 0.989 to 0.862 )
- Line: 5.0 % reduction (from 0.161 to 0.153 )
- Moons: 3.3% improvement (from 0.090 to 0.093 )
Computational Efficiency: The improved performance comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Training times approximately doubled, from an average of 36.97 seconds for the baseline to 75.19 seconds for the final model across all datasets. Inference times also increased, but to a lesser extent.

\subsection*{6.2 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS}
Figure [ provides a visual comparison of the generated samples across different runs and datasets. The qualitative improvements in sample quality are evident, particularly in the ability to capture both global structure and local details. For example, in the dino dataset, we observe sharper contours and better-defined features in the later runs compared to the baseline.
\subsection*{6.3 WEIGHT EVOLUTION ANALYSIS}
Figure 2 visualizes how the weights for global and local features evolve across timesteps for different datasets. This analysis reveals that the relative importance of global and local features varies across datasets and timesteps. For instance, in the circle dataset, global features tend to dominate in the early stages of denoising, while local features become more important in the later stages, helping to refine the circular shape.
\subsection*{6.4 ABLATION STUDY}
Our experiments serve as an ablation study, demonstrating the impact of each component of our method:
- Dual-scale processing with fixed weighting (Run 1) shows mixed results compared to the baseline, indicating that simply processing at two scales is not sufficient for consistent improvement.
- Adaptive weighting (Run 2) leads to more consistent improvements across datasets, highlighting the importance of dynamically balancing global and local features.
- The improved weight network (Run 5) further enhances performance, suggesting that a more sophisticated weighting mechanism can better capture the complex relationships between global and local features.
\subsection*{6.5 LIMITATIONS}
Despite the overall improvements, our method has some limitations:
- Increased computational cost may make it less suitable for applications with strict time constraints.
- Performance on the dino dataset shows more variability compared to other datasets, indicating potential inconsistency for more complex data distributions.
- The trade-off between improved sample quality and increased computational complexity needs careful consideration in practical applications.
\subsection*{6.6 Hyperparameters and Fairness Considerations}
All experiments used consistent hyperparameters across runs: 10,000 training steps, Adam optimizer with learning rate 3 \times 10^-4, batch size 256, and 100 diffusion timesteps. The consistency in hyperparameters ensures fair comparisons between different runs. However, it's worth noting that these hyperparameters were not extensively tuned, and there may be room for further optimization.
In conclusion, our adaptive dual-scale denoising approach demonstrates promising results in improving the quality of generated samples for low-dimensional diffusion models. The ability to dynamically balance global and local features leads to consistent improvements in KL divergence across multiple datasets, with visual improvements in sample quality. However, these improvements come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Further research is needed to address the limitations and improve the robustness of the adaptive weighting mechanism across a wider range of data complexities.
\section*{7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
This paper introduced an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global structure and local details in generated samples.

Our work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the denoising process in low-dimensional spaces and opens new avenues for improving diffusion models in various domains. The principles of adaptive dual-scale processing and dynamic feature balancing demonstrated in this study have potential applications beyond low-dimensional data, possibly extending to more complex, higherdimensional domains.
Future work could explore:
1. Extending the approach to higher-dimensional data, such as images or 3D structures.
2. Investigating more sophisticated weighting mechanisms, possibly leveraging attention mechanisms or graph neural networks.
3. Reducing computational overhead through more efficient network architectures or adaptive computation techniques.
4. Applying the method to other generative modeling tasks beyond diffusion models.
5. Conducting a more extensive theoretical analysis of the interplay between global and local features in diffusion models.
In conclusion, our adaptive dual-scale denoising approach represents a significant step forward in improving the quality and fidelity of low-dimensional diffusion models. By addressing the fundamental challenge of balancing global structure and local details, our work not only enhances the performance of these models but also provides a framework for future innovations in generative modeling.
