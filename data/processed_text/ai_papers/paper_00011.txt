}

\begin{abstract}
Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generating highdimensional data, but their application to low-dimensional datasets presents unique challenges due to limited spatial complexity and the need for precise noise scheduling. We introduce a novel multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism to enhance the performance of diffusion models on low-dimensional datasets. Our method employs a combination of coarse (5 \times 5) and fine (20 \times 20) grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process, with L1 regularization encouraging sparsity in fine-grained adjustments. We evaluate our approach on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our results show significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching, with KL divergence reductions of up to 41.6 % compared to standard diffusion models. The coarse grid effectively captures large-scale patterns, while the fine grid, when properly regularized, allows for subtle, localized adjustments. This adaptive noise scheduling substantially enhances the capabilities of diffusion models in low-dimensional spaces, opening new avenues for their application in scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis.

\section*{1 INTRODUCTION}
Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving remarkable success in generating high-dimensional data such as images and audio [Ho et al. (2020); [Yang et al. (2023). These models work by gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process, effectively denoising the data to generate new samples. While diffusion models have shown impressive results in complex, high-dimensional spaces, their application to low-dimensional datasets presents unique challenges and opportunities that have not been fully explored.
Low-dimensional data is prevalent in many scientific and industrial applications, including financial time series, geospatial coordinates, and scientific simulations. Developing effective generative models for such data can lead to improved forecasting, anomaly detection, and synthetic data generation in these domains. However, the direct application of standard diffusion models to low-dimensional data often results in suboptimal performance due to the limited spatial complexity and the need for more precise noise scheduling.
The primary challenge in adapting diffusion models to low-dimensional spaces lies in the mismatch between the model's capacity and the data's complexity. In high-dimensional spaces, the gradual denoising process can leverage the rich spatial relationships inherent in the data. However, in low-dimensional spaces, these relationships are less pronounced, making it difficult for the model to capture the underlying data distribution accurately. Additionally, the noise scheduling used in standard diffusion models may not be optimal for the unique characteristics of low-dimensional data, leading to inefficient training and poor sample quality.
To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism for diffusion models. Our approach employs a combination of coarse (5 \times 5) and fine (2 \times 20) grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process, allowing the model to capture both largescale patterns and fine-grained details in low-dimensional data distributions. The key contributions of our work are:
- A multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism that enhances the performance of diffusion models on low-dimensional datasets.
- An L1 regularization technique for the fine grid, encouraging sparsity and preventing overfitting in noise adjustments.
- A comprehensive evaluation of our approach on four diverse 2D datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching.
- Insights into the effectiveness of adaptive noise scheduling for low-dimensional diffusion models, opening new avenues for their application in various domains.
We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models. We observe KL divergence reductions of up to 36.8 % for the line dataset and 22.5 % for the moons dataset, indicating a substantial enhancement in the model's ability to capture the underlying data distribution. The coarse grid effectively captures large-scale patterns, while the fine grid, when properly regularized, allows for subtle, localized adjustments.
Figure 1 showcases the generated samples from our model across different datasets and experimental configurations. The visual quality and distribution of these samples highlight the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the underlying data distributions.
The success of our grid-based noise adaptation mechanism in low-dimensional spaces suggests promising directions for future research. Extending this approach to higher-dimensional data and exploring its applicability to specific domain problems, such as financial modeling or geospatial analysis, could lead to significant advancements in these fields. Furthermore, the insights gained from our work may inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities.
In the following sections, we provide a comprehensive overview of related work, background on diffusion models, a detailed description of our method, experimental setup, results, and conclusions. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on diffusion models and offers a novel approach to enhancing their performance in low-dimensional spaces, potentially broadening their applicability across diverse domains.
\section*{2 RELATED WORK}
Our work on enhancing diffusion models for low-dimensional data builds upon several key areas of research in generative modeling. We discuss relevant advancements in adaptive noise scheduling, applications of diffusion models to low-dimensional data, and spatial adaptations in generative models.
\subsection*{2.1 ADAPTIVE NOISE SCHEDULING IN DIFFUSION MODELS}
Recent work has highlighted the importance of noise scheduling in diffusion models. The Elucidating Diffusion Models (EDM) framework Karras et al. provides insights into the design space of diffusion-based generative models, emphasizing the role of noise scheduling in model performance. While EDM focuses on high-dimensional data such as images, our work extends the concept of adaptive noise scheduling to low-dimensional spaces.
Unlike EDM, which proposes a global noise schedule optimization, our approach introduces spatiallyaware noise adaptation through a multi-scale grid mechanism. This distinction is crucial in lowdimensional settings, where the limited spatial complexity necessitates more fine-grained control over the noise distribution.
\subsection*{2.2 Low-DIMENSIONAL APPLICATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS}
The application of diffusion models to low-dimensional data has gained attention recently, with works like TabDDPM [Kotelnikov et al. (2022) adapting these models for tabular data generation. While

TabDDPM demonstrates the potential of diffusion models in handling structured, low-dimensional data, it primarily focuses on categorical and mixed-type variables.
Our work differs from TabDDPM in several key aspects. First, we specifically target continuous 2D data, which presents unique challenges in capturing spatial relationships. Second, our multi-scale grid approach provides a more flexible framework for adapting to various low-dimensional distributions, as evidenced by our experiments on diverse 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons).
\subsection*{2.3 GRID-BASED AND SPATIAL ADAPTATIONS IN GENERATIVE MODELS}
Grid-based and spatial adaptations have been explored in other generative modeling frameworks, particularly in GANs[Goodfellow et al., and VAEs[Kingma & Welling] (2014). These approaches often involve spatially-aware discriminators or encoders to capture local structures in data.
Our work brings the concept of spatial adaptation to diffusion models, addressing the unique challenges posed by the iterative denoising process. Unlike GANs or VAEs, where spatial adaptations primarily affect the generation or encoding step, our multi-scale grid mechanism influences the entire diffusion trajectory. This allows for more nuanced control over the generation process, particularly beneficial in low-dimensional spaces where small variations can significantly impact the final distribution.
In conclusion, our work addresses a gap in the existing literature by introducing a spatially-aware, multi-scale noise adaptation mechanism specifically designed for low-dimensional diffusion models. By combining insights from adaptive noise scheduling, low-dimensional applications, and spatial adaptations in generative models, we provide a novel approach that enhances the performance of diffusion models in capturing complex low-dimensional distributions.
\section*{3 BACKGROUND}
Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, building upon the foundations of variational autoencoders (VAEs) [Kingma & Welling and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [Goodfellow et al. (2014). These models are rooted in the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics[Schl-Dickstein et al. (2015) and have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality samples across various domains [Ho et al. (2020).
The core concept behind diffusion models is the gradual addition of noise to data, followed by learning to reverse this process. This approach allows the model to capture complex data distributions by breaking down the generation process into a series of simpler denoising steps [Yang et al. (2023). The process can be described in two main phases:
1. Forward diffusion: A data point x_0 is gradually corrupted with Gaussian noise over T timesteps, resulting in a sequence of increasingly noisy versions x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T.
2. Reverse diffusion: The model learns to reverse this process; generating samples by iteratively denoising random noise.
Recent advancements in diffusion models have focused on improving their efficiency and applicability to various data types. Notable works include the Elucidating Diffusion Models (EDM) framework [Karras et al. , which provides insights into the design space of diffusion-based generative models, and TabDPM [Kotelnikov et al. , which adapts diffusion models for tabular data generation.
While these advancements have significantly improved the performance of diffusion models in highdimensional spaces, their application to low-dimensional data presents unique challenges that require careful consideration.
\subsection*{3.1 PROBLEM SETTING}
Let \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d be a low-dimensional data space, where d is typically small (e.g., d=2 in our experiments). The forward diffusion process is defined as:
\[
q(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_t-1)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t ; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \mathbf{x}_t-1, \beta_t \mathbf{I})
\]
where \beta_t is the noise schedule at timestep t, and \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean \mu and covariance matrix \Sigma.
The goal is to learn a reverse process that can generate high-quality samples by gradually denoising random noise:
\[
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t-1 \mid \mathbf{x}_t)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t-1 ; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
\]
where \theta represents the parameters of the model.
In low-dimensional settings, we make the following key observations:
1. Limited spatial complexity: Low-dimensional data has fewer spatial relationships to exploit during the diffusion process compared to high-dimensional data (e.g., images).
2. Increased sensitivity to noise scheduling: The choice of noise schedule \beta_t becomes more critical in low-dimensional spaces, as small variations can have a more pronounced effect on the generated samples.
3. Need for adaptive noise levels: To capture the nuances of low-dimensional data distributions, spatially adaptive noise levels may be beneficial.
These considerations motivate our proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, which aims to address the unique challenges posed by low-dimensional data in the context of diffusion models. Our approach, detailed in Section 4 leverages a combination of coarse (5 \times 5) and fine (20 \times 20) grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process, allowing for more precise control over the generation of low-dimensional samples.
\section*{4 METHOD}
Building upon the foundations of diffusion models introduced in Section 3 we propose a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism to address the unique challenges posed by low-dimensional data. Our method enhances the standard diffusion process by introducing spatially and temporally adaptive noise levels, allowing for more precise control over the generation process in low-dimensional spaces.
\subsection*{4.1 Multi-Scale Grid Structure}
We introduce two learnable grids: a coarse 5 \times 5 grid G_c for capturing large-scale patterns and a fine 20 \times 20 grid G_f for localized adjustments. The noise adjustment factor \alpha(\mathbf{x}, t) for a data point \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X} at timestep t is defined as:
\[
\alpha(\mathbf{x}_t, t)=\alpha_c(\mathbf{x}, t) \cdot \alpha_f(\mathbf{x}, t)
\]
where \alpha_c(\mathbf{x}, t) and \alpha_f(\mathbf{x}, t) are bilinearly interpolated values from G_c and G_f, respectively. Both grids are initialized with ones and learned during training, allowing the model to discover optimal noise patterns.
\subsection*{4.2 Modified Diffusion Process}
We modify the forward diffusion process defined in Section 3 to incorporate the grid-based noise adaptation:
\[
q(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_t-1)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t ; \sqrt{1-\beta_t \mathbf{x}_t-1}, \alpha(\mathbf{x}_t-1, t) \beta_t \mathbf{I})
\]
This adaptation allows the noise level to vary spatially and temporally, providing more precise control over the diffusion process in low-dimensional spaces.
The reverse process is similarly modified:
\[
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t-1 \mid x_t)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t-1 ; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \alpha(\mathbf{x}_t, t)), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \alpha(\boldsymbol{x}_t, t)))
\]
4.3 Model Architecture
We employ a modified MLPDenoiser architecture that incorporates the noise adjustment factor:
\[
\mu_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \alpha)=\operatorname{MLP}(\left[\mathbf{x}_t ; \operatorname{emb}(t) ; \alpha\right])
\]
where \operatorname{emb}(t) is a sinusoidal time embedding and [\cdot:] denotes concatenation. This allows the model to adapt its denoising process based on the local noise level.
\subsection*{4.4 Training and Loss Function}
The model is trained to minimize the variational lower bound { }^[100 Ho et al. { }^[2020], with an additional L1 regularization term for the fine grid:
\[
\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{ELBO}+\lambda\left\|G_f-\mathbf{1}\right\|_1
\]
where \lambda is a hyperparameter controlling the regularization strength. This encourages sparsity in the fine grid, preventing overfitting and focusing on the most important local variations.
\subsection*{4.5 SAMPLING PROCESS}
During sampling, we use the learned grids to adjust noise levels dynamically:
\[
\mathbf{x}_t-1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_t}}(\mathbf{x}_t-\frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1-\alpha_t}} \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t, \alpha(\mathbf{x}_t, t)))+\sigma_t \mathbf{z}
\]
where \mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) and \sigma_t^2=\beta_t \alpha(\mathbf{x}_t, t).
Our multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism offers several advantages for low-dimensional diffusion models:
1. Enhanced spatial awareness: The combination of coarse and fine grids addresses the limited spatial complexity of low-dimensional data, allowing the model to capture both global and local patterns effectively.
2. Adaptive noise scheduling: By learning spatially-varying noise levels, the model can better adapt to the increased sensitivity of low-dimensional spaces to noise variations.
3. Regularized fine-grained control: The L1 regularization on the fine grid encourages sparse adjustments, mitigating the risk of overfitting in low-dimensional spaces.
These advantages enable our method to better capture the nuances of low-dimensional data distributions, leading to improved sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models, as demonstrated in our experimental results (Section \left.\frac{\theta}{\theta}).
\section*{5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP}
To evaluate our multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, we conducted experiments on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. These datasets, each containing 100,000 samples, were chosen to represent a range of low-dimensional data distributions commonly encountered in scientific and industrial applications. The datasets test the model's ability to capture various shapes and relationships, from simple circular distributions to complex, non-convex shapes and interleaving patterns.
We implemented our method using a modified version of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) [Ho et al. (2020). The core of our model is an MLPDenoiser with the following architecture:
- Input dimension: 2
- Embedding dimension: 128
- Hidden dimension: 256
- Number of hidden layers: 3
- Activation function: ReLU
Our noise scheduler uses a linear beta schedule with 100 timesteps. The multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism employs a 5 \times 5 coarse grid and a 20 \times 20 fine grid, both initialized with ones and learned during training.
We trained our models using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4 and a batch size of 256 for 10,000 steps. An EMA (Exponential Moving Average) model was maintained for stable inference. The L1 regularization weight for the fine grid was set to 0.001 .
To evaluate performance, we used the following metrics:
- Evaluation Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual noise on a held-out validation set.
- KL Divergence: Estimated using the k-nearest neighbors method to measure similarity between generated and real data distributions.
- Training Time: Total time required to train the model for 10,000 steps.
- Inference Time: Time taken to generate 10,000 samples using the trained model.
- Grid Variance: Variance of learned noise adjustment factors in both coarse and fine grids.
We compared our model against a baseline DDPM without adaptive noise scheduling and conducted ablation studies with:
- Single-scale grid (10 \times 10) without L1 regularization
- Multi-scale grid (5 \times 5 coarse, 20 \times 20 fine) without L1 regularization
- Multi-scale grid ( 5 \times 5 coarse, 20 \times 20 fine) with L1 regularization (our full model)
All experiments were implemented using PyTorch and run on a single GPU. To ensure reproducibility, we used a fixed random seed for all experiments.
\section*{6 RESULTS}
Our multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline DDPM model across all four datasets. Table summarizes the key metrics for each model configuration.

\end{tabular}
The evaluation loss, measured as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual noise, shows a consistent improvement across our proposed models. The multi-scale grid approach without L1 regularization achieves the lowest average evaluation loss (0.5473), representing a 13.3 % reduction compared to the baseline DDPM. Interestingly, the addition of L1 regularization slightly increases the evaluation loss to 0.5938 , but as we'll see, it leads to improvements in other metrics.

improvements observed in our metrics, particularly for the more complex shapes like the dino and moons datasets.
As shown in Table our proposed models incur increased training times compared to the baseline DDPM. The multi-scale grid approach with L1 regularization takes approximately 79 % longer to train. However, this increased training time is offset by the significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching. Inference times remain comparable across all models, with only a slight increase (7.9% for our full model) relative to the baseline.
Figure 3 shows the training loss over time for each dataset across all model configurations.
The training loss curves demonstrate consistent convergence across all datasets, with our multi-scale grid approaches showing faster initial decreases in loss compared to the baseline DDPM. The L1regularized version exhibits slightly higher final training loss, which aligns with our observations of

Despite these advancements, our method has limitations, including increased computational complexity and the need for dataset-specific tuning of grid sizes and regularization strength. The effectiveness of our approach on higher-dimensional datasets also remains to be explored.
Future work directions include:
1. Extending the method to higher-dimensional datasets (3D, 4D, etc.) to broaden its applicability. 2. Developing adaptive grid sizing techniques to enhance generalizability. 3. Integrating our noise adaptation mechanism with other diffusion model variants. 4. Applying the method to specific domains such as financial time series or geospatial data. 5. Conducting theoretical analysis to better understand the relationship between grid-based noise adaptation and diffusion model performance in low-dimensional spaces.
In conclusion, our multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism represents a significant step forward in enhancing the capabilities of diffusion models for low-dimensional data. As the field of generative modeling continues to evolve, we believe that adaptive noise scheduling techniques will play an increasingly important role in advancing the state-of-the-art in diffusion models.
